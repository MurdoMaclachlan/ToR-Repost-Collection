# Wanted Templates

Each *specific* meme we want a template for has an issue. If you want to do one of the issues, reply "claim" to an unclaimed issue and open a pull request, including the template in a .md file and an example meme in a .jpg, .jpeg or .png, with both files contained inside a subfolder of /generic or /traa. Once it's merged, reply "done" and you're all done.

We are also looking for various [Wojak](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wojak) templates, but these are so many and so diverse we do not have a specific issue for all of them. If you have one specific template for Wojak, please open a pull requests. Wojak templates are being kept under the /wojak folder.
