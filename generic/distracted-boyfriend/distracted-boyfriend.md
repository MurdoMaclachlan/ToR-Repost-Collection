[*Distracted boyfriend meme: A masculine person with light skin and brown hair is walking away from the camera. A feminine person in a red dress walks towards the camera, and the masculine person is looking at her. Their presumed girlfriend (feminine person with light skin and brown, long hair, with a light blue shirt and blue jeans) looks disgusted at this behaviour. Each person has a label:*]

**Boyfriend**: {{REPLACE ME}}

**Girlfriend**: {{REPLACE ME}}

**Red Dress Person**: {{REPLACE ME}}
