A meme taken from the movie series "Despicable Me". Gru presents from a flipchart that has been modified by his children. The first 2 slides normally contain a normal process, like "I start a project", "I copy the example code". The last 2 whiteboards generally contain the same text, and are an unexpected side-effect, such as "It fails to compile"
