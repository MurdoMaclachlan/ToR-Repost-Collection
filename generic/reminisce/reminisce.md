**Panel 1**

[*A post-apocolyptic styled scene. Two men sit on the ground, their legs crossed. Behind them is a derelict shopfront, the glass of the store window shattered on the ground in front of it. A red drape or fabric of some kind hangs in the window. One of the supporting beams is cracked about a third of the way up. On the floor next to the men is rubbish and rubble; a document with a skull on it lays in the corner of the image. The man on the left is dressed in what looks like a yellow fallout hood and a grey gas mask, with a green filter. He wears rubbery grey trousers. The man to the right wears a camoflague top, and rubberized dungarees with (presumably) his name, John, printed on them. He looks down, writing on a piece of paper*]

**Yellow Hood**: I miss the internet

**Panel 2**

[*The same scene as before, but John has finished drawing on the paper. He holds it up to Yellow Hood, who looks over*]

[*A similar scene to __Panel 2__. Yellow Hood has taken the paper from John, and holds it, turning to look to him. John turns and looks to Yellow Hood*]

**Yellow Hood**: Thank you
