# Templates for [Transcribers of Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/transcribersofreddit)

### An ***unofficial*** repository of templates collated by volunteers for transcribing reddit posts. 

This allows us to transcribe with more ease ~~and get gammas faster~~, provide image transcriptions for those with vision impairments/ who use text-to-speech software, and those on mobile or with limited data.

The original repository was created by **/u/VoidCraftedGaming**; much credit to him. **/u/MurdoMaclachlan** forked the repository after activity in it died.

For a list of wanted templates, see [here](https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/ToR-Repost-Collection/blob/master/WANTED_TEMPLATES.md).
