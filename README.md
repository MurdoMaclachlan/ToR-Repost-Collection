# Templates for [Transcribers of Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/transcribersofreddit)

### An ***unofficial*** repository of templates collated by volunteers for transcribing reddit posts. 

This allows us to transcribe with more ease ~~and get gammas faster~~, provide image transcriptions for those with vision impairments/ who use text-to-speech software, and those on mobile or with limited data.

The original repository was created by **u/VoidCraftedGaming**; much credit to him. **u/MurdoMaclachlan** forked the repository after activity in it died.

Also see [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1COYykgomeJ5CPIPo8zhb8-Z-qUrMH1hUH4VYM3pG6bM/edit) for a long list of crowdsourced templates. The formats they've used are different from ToR's, but I'm slowly reformatting them to our templates and incorporating them into the collection.

For a list of my progress with the doc (i.e. what templates I have so far added from it), look [here](https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/ToR-Repost-Collection/blob/master/GOOGLE_DOC.md).
