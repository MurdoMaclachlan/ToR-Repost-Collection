This image seems to be taken from a computer's webcam. A Wojak woman in a pink and purple striped tank top sits in a blue and black gaming chair in a green-walled room. The walls are falling apart, with many cracks and miscellaneous stains, and the words "CHICKEN TENDIES!" scrawled crudely above her bed, which is visible in the corner; it has many pillows and pink sheets. Strewn about the room is a lot of junk, including two empty takeout drink cups, a Nintendo DS charging on the floor, a guitar, and what might be a blue pair of pants just out of frame. A man Wojak, unshaven, carries in a blue TV dinner tray. On the back wall is a whiteboard that is divided into two halves; one half tallies 'Princess Points,' of which 23 have been achieved. The other half is a list, as follows: 

-please dump used diapers in hamper

-no computer after 10 pm

-no videogames after 10pm

-I love you no matter what

A hamper labeled 'Used diapers only!' is underneath the whiteboard.
