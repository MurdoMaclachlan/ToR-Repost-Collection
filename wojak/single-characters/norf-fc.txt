A lumpy-bodied man with unkempt hair has a bruised and bleeding face. A black boot-print is stamped across his face. As if in mid-impact, two teeth and blood spatter fly away from his face and a green bottle of beer flies from his outstretched hand, spilling. He wears a red shirt with the text 'NORF F.C' over the left breast area.
